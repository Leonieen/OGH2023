## Course Overview

This session was dedicated to exploring the integration of MovingPandas and DVC in Mobility Data Science. The course was designed for those with a basic understanding of (Geo)Pandas and version control systems like Git, focusing on practical applications of these advanced tools in mobility data analysis.

## MovingPandas

MovingPandas stands as a powerful Python library for analyzing and visualizing movement data. Built on GeoPandas, it provides comprehensive functionalities to manipulate and plot trajectories, offering a robust toolkit for movement analytics. For examples of analytics supported by MovingPandas, attendees were encouraged to visit: MovingPandas Examples.

## DVC (Data Version Control)

DVC is a groundbreaking tool for data version control and machine learning experiment tracking. It operates similarly to source code version control systems, such as Git, but is geared towards managing data and experiments. In this session, DVC was used in tandem with Git to maintain a comprehensive track of movement data analytics workflows.
